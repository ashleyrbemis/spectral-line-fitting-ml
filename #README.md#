Machine Learning for Spectral Line Fitting📖 OverviewThis project implements a deep learning model (a Convolutional Neural Network) to analyze spectral data and automatically identify the number and parameters of underlying Gaussian components. Traditional fitting methods can be slow and require good initial guesses, whereas this ML approach aims to provide a fast and accurate initial analysis of complex spectra.Problem Statement: Given a noisy one-dimensional spectrum, the goal is to predict the parameters (Amplitude, Mean, Sigma) for each Gaussian component present.🛠️ Technologies UsedPython 3.10Conda for environment managementTensorFlow / Keras for building and training the neural networkScikit-learn for data scaling and model evaluationNumPy & Pandas for data manipulationH5Py / PyTables for efficient data storageMatplotlib / Seaborn for data visualization📂 Project StructureThe repository is organized as follows:.

⚙️ Setup and InstallationTo run this project, you'll need to set up the specified Conda environment.Clone the repository (once it's on GitHub):git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-name>
Create and activate the Conda environment:The environment is named spectral_ML_env.# Create the environment with Python 3.10
conda create -n spectral_ML_env python=3.10

# Activate the environment
conda activate spectral_ML_env
Install the required libraries:With the environment active, install packages using the following two commands. It's important to install pytables with Conda first.# First, install PyTables using Conda
conda install pytables

# Then, install the remaining packages with Pip

🚀 How to Run the ProjectFollow these steps in order from the root directory of the project.Step 1: Generate the Training & Validation DataThis script creates the spectra_for_ml_training.h5 and spectra_for_ml_validation.h5 files needed for the next step.python generate_spectra_for_ML.py
Step 2: Train the Neural Network ModelThis script will load the training data, build the CNN model, train it, and save the final model and data scalers into the keras_N_component_model/ directory.python train_NN_model.py
Step 3: Evaluate the Trained ModelThis script loads the model you just trained and runs it on the validation dataset to produce performance metrics and visualizations of sample fits.python evaluate_model_results.py
📊 ResultsThe model was evaluated on a hold-out validation set containing a mix of 1- and 2-component spectra. The evaluation focused on two key areas: the accuracy of the predicted Gaussian parameters (a regression task) and the model's ability to identify the correct number of components (a classification task).Parameter Prediction PerformanceThe most meaningful metric for regression is the R² score calculated on only the active (non-zero) true components, as this reflects the model's true predictive power on real spectral features.R² Score (Active Parameters): 0.9235Interpretation: The model successfully explains over 92% of the variance in the true parameters of the actual Gaussian components. This indicates a very high level of accuracy and predictive power for the features it identifies.Performance Breakdown by Parameter Type (Active Components)The model shows strong performance in predicting the position (Mean) and width (Sigma) of the spectral lines.ParameterR² ScoreMean (Position)0.7303Sigma (Width)0.6434Amplitude0.2341Component Count Detection PerformanceThe model's ability to implicitly detect the number of components was evaluated by counting how many predicted amplitudes were above a physically-motivated threshold.Component Count Accuracy: 52.7%Interpretation: The model correctly identifies the number of components in over half of the validation cases. A confusion matrix is saved to the plots directory for a more detailed breakdown of classification performance.✨ Future EnhancementsPotential improvements and future directions for this project include:Improve Component Counting & Amplitude Prediction: The model's primary weaknesses are its moderate accuracy in counting components and its lower R² score for amplitude. Future work should focus on architectures or loss functions that specifically target these areas.Implement a Multi-Task Model: A dedicated classification head could be added to the network to explicitly predict the number of components, which may improve both counting and regression performance.Train on Real Observational Data: Adapt the pipeline to use real-world astronomical data to test its robustness and practical applicability.Hyperparameter Tuning: Systematically tune hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size, network depth) using a library like KerasTuner or Optuna to optimize model performance.📄 LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License.
